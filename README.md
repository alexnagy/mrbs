As the administrator of a co-working space with several meeting rooms, I want to offer my clients a meeting room booking system app. Each client should be able to make a booking for a certain available time slot, to see bookings made by other users, to change their booking if they find a better time slot or to delete their booking if it is no longer needed. I also want the application to work offline, with the following constraints:
- the user can't delete or change any booking;
- the user can only see the bookings that were available last time he/she was online;
- the user can create a booking which will be denied if it will be in conflict with another one created while he/she was offline; in this case the user should be announced.

It would be nice to have a secure authentication system, as well as a feature that lets you ask people that made other bookings whether they would like to exchange their booking with yours.
